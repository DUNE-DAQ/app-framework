/**
 * @file ThreadHelper.hpp ThreadHelper class declarations
 *
 * ThreadHelper defines a std::thread which runs the do_work()
 * function as well as methods to start and stop that thread.
 * This file is intended to help reduce code duplication for the common
 * task of starting and stopping threads. As in artdaq, std::thread may
 * be replaced by boost::thread to allow setting the stack size at a
 * later date if that functionality is found to be necessary.
 *
 * This is part of the DUNE DAQ Application Framework, copyright 2020.
 * Licensing/copyright details are in the COPYING file that you should have
 * received with this code.
